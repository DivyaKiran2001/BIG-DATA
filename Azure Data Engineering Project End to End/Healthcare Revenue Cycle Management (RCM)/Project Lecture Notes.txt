As part of RCM we have 2 main aspects

- Accounts Receivable (AR)
- Accounts Payable


Patient paying is often a risk

scenarios when patient has to pay

Low Insurance - these insurance providers put most of the burden on patients..

Private Clinics
Dental treatments
Deductibles

2 objectives for AR
- Bring cash
- also minimize the collection period

the probability of collecting your full amount decreases with time..

- 93% of money due 30 days old...
- 85% of money due 60 days old...
- 73% of money due 90 days old...

KPI to measure AR and set benchmarks...

1. AR > 90 days...

200K USD older then 90 days

1 million USD

200k / 1 million = 20%


2. Days in AR

1 million USD in 100 days

per day 10000 USD

400K USD AR

40 DAY

45 Days..


what do we have to do as a Data Engineering

we will have data in various Sources

we need to create a pipeline, the result of this pipeline will be fact tables and dimension tables, will help the reporting team to generate the KPI
